<!-- 
    Think about:
correct usage of HTML - can you justify your choice of HTML tags / attributes?

Semantic HTML - does your page convey meaning to a visually impaired user as well as a developer?

Have you tested your codes accessibility in any way? (WAVE, Lighthouse, HTML checker etc) Could you navigate your page without using a mouse?

SEO (search engine optimisation) - have you included relevant information in your <head> <title> and <meta> tags? 

    Have you used alt tags? What description have you chosen to use (if any at all) and why?
