        <h2>COVID RESTRICTION UPDATE</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the pandemic we have strove to make the surgery as safe as possible for all our patients and staff, we will continue to do so.</br>
            </br>
            From the 19TH JULY 2021 NOTHING WILL CHANGE AT THE SURGERY â€“ Patients will still need to wear a mask, socially distance and use hand sanitiser in the surgery and staff will continue to wear PPE. </br>
            </br>
            If you arrive without a mask and are not exempt, you will be asked to leave.
